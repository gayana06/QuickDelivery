# QuickDelivery

1. Open the solution in VisualStudio
2. Build and run the project.
3. Load the swagger page at http://localhost:12345/swagger
4. Use the adminapi/products POST to add products to the system. Proper validation messages will be thrown. i.e if the same item to be added multiple times
5. Use adminapi/products GET to verify added data.
6. Use /customerapi/products/delivery GET to retrieve possible delivery dates

See the screenshots in 'QuickDelivery\ScreenShots' folder if needed.

Note: I did not add unit tests for all the code I wrote. It would be nice to add but it is an overkill at the moment.
